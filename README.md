This repository provides an example of a typical Python project

**NOTE**

**FUNCRIONALITY**

This app takes a csv file and a year and return the city and the month with highest temperature in given year

- run 
```bash
python -m pip install dist\weather-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
- then run
```bash
python -m weather.main {csv file} {year}

- the output:
```bash
